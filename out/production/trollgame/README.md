From my AP-CSA final comes a new project, the troll game. The goal of this simple, yet intuitive game is to get as much money as you can.
Battles are created with an immortal dragon named Archie. The goal is to chip at his health the best you can for the next person.

There are two types of trolls you can purchase with in-game money.
The first troll is the banker troll. He gives you a money bonus when you win a game! The more money trolls you have, the higher your bonus is!

The second troll is the fighter troll. The more fighter trolls you have, the higher the health of Archie is.
The more health Archie has, the higher the money you get when you defeat him in a round.
However if you have the same number of soldiers as his randomly generated health (difficulty multiplier asked first), its a 50/50 shot of winning!
If you have less soldiers than his health, you loose and also you loose money.
The more soldiers you have than his health, you gain money!

If you have a consistant win streak (usually with the easiest levels), a bounty starts. You can choose to flee or fight the hellhound from which the bounty spawns.
If you defeat the hellhound, you gain immense amounts of money, speeding up your progress. However if you loose, you're executed and it's game over.
If you choose to flee, the odds are even in escaping. You loose less people and money if you dont make it back intact.

Each day, you gain $10. Enjoy the game!
