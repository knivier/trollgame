# trollgame
From my AP-CSA final comes a new project, the troll game. The goal of this simple, yet intuitive game is to get as much money as you can.

There are two types of trolls, both you can purchase with money. 
The first troll is a money troll. The more money trolls you have, the higher your bonus is each time you win a battle.
The second type of troll is a battle troll. The more battle trolls you have, the more health the enemy will have on average.
You're fighting an immortal dragon named "Archie". All you're trying to do is take some of his health down for the next soldiers.
The more health Archie has, the more money you can get if you defeat him.
