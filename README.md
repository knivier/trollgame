From a class project to a hobby, here's the troll game! The goal of this simple text-based game is to get as much money as you can.
You can commandeer trolls, as your village once did them a favour. You can help, in return.
There are currently 2 trolls. The first is a fighter troll. The more you have, the higher your opponents health is. However, you're also more likely to beat him.
The second troll is a banker troll, and the more of this guy, the higher your win bonus is. 

Your opponent is Archie, for years thought to be immortal, but now people realize that Archie can be killed. The more health Archie has, upon successful battle win, the more money you recieve! If you battle him and you have more soldiers than his random generated health (difficulty & numoftrolls taken into account), you can win! If you have the same number of trolls, your chances of winning are random. If you have less soldiers than his health, you loose and money is lost. 

If you keep winning (found on easier difficulties), a bounty may start. Thisinvolves hunters who realize you're becoming too powerful, and set a hellhound to kill you. 
You can choose to flee, but there's a small chance the hellhound can injure you, causing you to loose money. However there is also a chance that you can flee without him injuring you, making it the safest option!
The other option is to fight him, which is significantly more difficult than Archie. If you win, you can recieve insane amounts of money. If you loose, your balance can go into the negatives. Harder difficulties (3+) will result in a game-over.

Upon game start, you can choose your difficulty, and number of days you wish to play. Try to gain as much money as you can, and you can score a high award! 
Each day you recieve $10 as a bonus. In higher difficulties, this doesn't occur.
There are many different logistics to the game, but they can't be put in a README file, so go ahead and try the game out!

THE MINIMUM VERSION WE RECCOMEND FOR YOU TO RUN IS v4.2
